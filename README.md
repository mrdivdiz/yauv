Yet Another Unearthed Vita - Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta port

Known bugs: A LOT (navigate to issues)

**No ragdolls because the way they made is no longer supported in Unity 5**

This repo contains source code and is defined to gather info about bugs & crashes.

**Project goal:**
- Stable perfomance at least capped on 20 FPS
- Graphics maxed out: bumped shaders, cubemap reflections, SSAO and other post-effects implemented
- Full version of the game, including survival mode
- Development of open-source unity post-effect kit for PS Vita, which will take homebrew port graphics on a whole new level
- Insert your joke about drakeface here
