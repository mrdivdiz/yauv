**11.11.21 Found a CRITICAL perfomance bug related to mesh import.**

Yet Another Unearthed Vita - Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta port

**Known bugs:**

Crash after death in the prologue


**Nearest TODO:**

- LOD system in progress
- Improved textures
- Rip unused materials
- Master better post-effects
- Add Survival level support


**No ragdolls because the way they made is no longer supported in Unity 5**

This repo contains source code and is defined to gather info about bugs & crashes.

**Project goal:**
- Stable perfomance at least capped on 20 FPS
- Graphics maxed out: bumped shaders, cubemap reflections, SSAO and other post-effects implemented
- Full version of the game, including survival mode
- Development of open-source unity post-effect kit for PS Vita, which will take homebrew port graphics on a whole new level
- Insert your joke about drakeface here
