**27.11.21 Release v0.9.1.**

Yet Another Unearthed Vita - Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta port
Overclocking is persistent for this project to run smooth.

**Known bugs:**

Crash after death in the prologue


**Nearest TODO:**

- Implement separate rendering via 2 cameras, where background is in lower resolution and without any post-effects
- Remove debug console
- Push vita post-effects with separated rendering to github as a standalone package with required explainations
- Add Survival level support
- Language fonts?
- Settings GUI IS thrashed
- Do something with DoF


**No ragdolls because the way they made is no longer supported in Unity 5**

This repo contains source code and is defined to gather info about bugs & crashes.

**Project goal:**
- Stable perfomance at least capped on 20 FPS
- Graphics maxed out: bumped shaders, cubemap reflections, SSAO and other post-effects implemented
- Full version of the game, including survival mode
- Development of open-source unity post-effect kit for PS Vita, which will take homebrew port graphics on a whole new level
- Insert your joke about drakeface here
